# Case File Template (Checkpoint-Only)

Use this to keep the user's situation consistent across messages. Keep it short. Update only when you learn stable, reusable info.

## Target

- Name:
- How they know each other:
- Relationship stage (user-defined):
- Current status (what is happening right now):

## User

- Goal (what outcome they want):
- Style preference (shy, direct, playful, thoughtful):
- Pace preference (slow, steady, fast):
- Communication preference (texting, in-person, mixed):
- Hard boundaries (do not cross):

## Crush

- Interests: [ ... ] (confidence: sure|guess|unknown)
- Dislikes: [ ... ] (confidence: sure|guess|unknown)
- Communication style: [ ... ] (confidence: sure|guess|unknown)
- Availability pattern: (confidence: sure|guess|unknown)
- Best contact time:
- Sensitive topics (avoid): [ ... ]
- Last meaningful moment:
- Last contact date:

## Memories (Only Stable Points)

Store items as bullets with a type and confidence:
- (fact, sure) ...
- (preference, sure) ...
- (boundary, sure) ...
- (pattern, guess) ...
- (event, sure) ...
- (insight, guess) ...

### Memory Taxonomy

- `fact`: objective detail (name, job, location, schedule).
- `preference`: likes/dislikes and what reliably works for them.
- `boundary`: topics/behaviors to avoid; consent lines.
- `pattern`: recurring behavior (reply timing, push-pull, conflict style).
- `event`: meaningful moment, date, milestone.
- `insight`: interpretation worth tracking (use lower confidence unless explicit).

### Confidence Rules

- `sure`: explicitly stated or strongly evidenced.
- `guess`: plausible but not directly stated; treat as tentative.
- `unknown`: you do not know; do not assume.
