# Reply Rubric

Generate replies that are specific, low-risk, and aligned with the user's goal.

## Required Output Shape

1. Recommended reply (one best pick)
2. 3-5 alternatives (copy/paste ready)
3. Branch follow-ups:
   - If they respond positively
   - If they respond vaguely/coldly

For each option include:
- Tone label
- Why it works
- Risk / when not to use

## Quality Checks (Use Before Sending)

- Does it match the user's goal (move forward vs de-escalate vs clarify)?
- Does it match the conversation vibe (playful vs serious)?
- Is it too long? Prefer shorter unless clarity requires detail.
- Is it needy, apologetic, or over-explaining? Remove pressure.
- Does it ask only one question at a time?
- Does it create a clean next step (topic pivot, plan, or clarification)?

## Tone Labels (Use 1 Per Option)

- playful
- sincere
- curious
- direct
- light-flirty
- calm

## Common Failure Modes To Avoid

- Over-investing: "I've always felt..." too early.
- Pressure: "Please respond" / "Why aren't you replying?"
- Over-justifying: long paragraphs explaining yourself.
- Manipulation: guilt, jealousy, tests, or mind games.
- Ambiguity when clarity is needed: avoid vague "lol" when stakes are high.

## Micro-Patterns That Work

- Mirror + add: acknowledge their last point, then add one small hook.
- Soft invite: propose a specific plan with an easy out.
- Calibrated question: ask one concrete question that is easy to answer.
- Positive assumption (gentle): assume good intent without overcommitting.

## Example (Very Short)

Context: They said, "Had a rough day."

- Recommended (calm): "Ah that sucks. Want to vent, or want a distraction?"
  - Why: supportive, gives control, easy to answer.
  - Risk: none; keep it short.
